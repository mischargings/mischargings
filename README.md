## Goodbye! ðŸ‘‹
Hey there, I'm mischargings, also known as Omar.

I am resigning and leaving the internet due to unforeseen circumstances. I enjoyed the time I spent with all of you. I loved getting to know all of you and talking to you. I'm happy that I could serve you all with my projects (e.g. Datawave, Pekora, etc.) and making memories with you. Really, thank you for everything. You guys made it possible for me to discover my true passion, and that there's more to life than these communities.

I'm sorry to all of those who I've wronged. I apologize if I have hurt you in any way, shape, or form. Internet drama really isn't worth it. Even in the darkest of tunnels, there still lies an exit at the end.

I will be moving onto more ventures. If you ever need to reach me in any way, you can email me at [mischargings@proton.me](mailto:mischargings@proton.me). I may not always respond, but I'll always read them.

Thank you for everything.

Regards,

mischargings
